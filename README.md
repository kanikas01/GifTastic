# GifTastic

The purpose of this assignment is to dynamically populate a webpage using Ajax and the Giphy API.  

Each button adds ten gifs to the page (or less, if the query in question returns fewer than ten). Each gif is displayed on a card, along with the gif's rating and a button to add the gif to a user's "favorites" section. The user can also add their own buttons using the form provided.

The page uses Bootstrap for styling and is designed for desktop use, preferably with a width greater than 990px.
