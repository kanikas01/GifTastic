Each topic button adds ten gifs to the page (or less, if the query in question returns fewer than ten). Each gif is displayed on a card, along with the gif's rating and a button to add the gif to a user's "favorites" section. The user can also add their own topic buttons using the form provided.

The page uses Bootstrap for styling and is designed for desktop use, preferably with a width greater than 990px.
